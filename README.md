# TicTacToe-GUI-Kivy

### Introduction

This project is a simple GUI TicTacToe game written using the Kivy GUI Framework for Python.
Kivy is an easy, powerful, open-source and cross-platform framework to write GUI/NUI application for almost all platforms like Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS etc.

### Structure

The project is divided in 2 main files

- main.py
- tictactoe.kv

Kivy has MVC design approach as the graphic setting like layouts and widgets are made using the .kv file and the logic is in the main.py file.
All the contents of the .kv file can be made using the .py file but it is a lot cleaner and easier to write it in the .kv file.

### Running the application

#### Python File

- Have Python installed on your computer and set in path

#### Executable File

### Note

The project's purpose is practice and there are many things in the project that must be added and/or improved.
Some of the additions that I want to add are 
- Using the canvas to draw the winning line
- Game restart button
- Better user interface

- Flipped labels on the bottom of screen(for better view of 2nd player)
